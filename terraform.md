# Notes
**Terraform**:Allows to automate and manage the resource in the aws or azure using code.It basically is IAC in which we use code to automate the task of creation and 
deletion of resources.We can manage the wholem platform and its services.
It is a infra provisioning tool.
Terrafrom can cover vast varieties like k8s,aws and other cloud providers and then to same SaaS also.
Two approaches are there in this declarative and Imperative:
In declarative we give the terraform a declaration that we want these things at the end i.e we define the desired state of the infrastructure and in imperative we
define what things we want i.e we specify each step to achieve the desired state.Terrafrom works in declarative approach.
Addpoint:Terraform is used for creating the infra and sometimes configure it and ansible is used to configure that infra like deploying etc both as IAC.
TERRAFORM COMMANDS:
refresh:query infra provider to get current state.
